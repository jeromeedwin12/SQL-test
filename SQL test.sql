#7.What are Entities and Relationships?
/*
Entity:
 An entity can be a real-world object, either tangible or intangible,
that can be easily identifiable. For example, in a college database,
students, professors, workers, departments, and projects can be
referred to as entities. Each entity has some associated properties
that provide it an identity.

Relationships:
Relations or links between entities that have something to do with each other.
For example - The employees table in a company's database can be associated with
the salary table in the same database.
